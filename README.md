#Abstract
IMAGING AND EVALUATING THE MEMORY ACCESS FOR MALWARE

Research Material for PhD in Computer Engineering @ YasarUni

In this research, memory operations and access patterns for the malicious acts are examined and a contribution of a novel approach for extracting of memory access images is presented. In addition to extraction, methods of how these images can be used for detection and comparison is introduced through an image comparison technique.


Key Words: Malware Analysis, Malware Imaging, Memory Analysis, Dynamical Binary Analysis, Memory Operations Analysis. 


# Memory Images Graph Database Access

A Neo4j graph database with malware memory patterns are also generated within this research. To discuss, test and obtain access please email me.
